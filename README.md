# MIPS-CPU-using-C
The project resembles a MIPS CPU; written entirely in C. It takes assembly language input from a .ASM file, and it does, you already know, FETCH-DECODE-EXECUTE! This includes an assembly to MIPS-instruction to binary parser, and backwards; a memory module that stores code and data separately; and a fun UX..
